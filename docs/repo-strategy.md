# Code Mower Repo Strategy

Code Mower is a public Apache-2.0 OSS core. The repo strategy is to keep the
installable core useful on its own while private reference/product repos keep
validating real-world velocity, quality, and migration behavior without leaking
private product history into public docs.

## Repositories

- `code-mower`: public home for the installable Code Mower core.
- Private product/reference repos: continue validating Code Mower against real
  development, but public docs should not require access to them or name them as
  dependencies.
- Private commercial service repo: hosted benchmarking, reporting, ingestion,
  billing, and enterprise controls.

Public-facing docs should describe Code Mower as extracted from a production
multi-repo development workflow, not as a generated view of any specific private
product repo.

## Migration Principles

- Protect product development velocity. Code Mower migration work must not block
  feature, platform, deployment, or customer-impacting work.
- Keep product repo wrappers stable until the standalone package has CI, smoke
  tests, and real usage evidence.
- Move implementation ownership into the standalone repo in slices, with pinned
  product-repo consumption after each slice proves clean.
- Run standalone and repo-local implementations in shadow mode before changing
  defaults.
- Keep commercialization plans, hosted service internals, and private benchmark
  data outside the public OSS repo.

## Extraction Phases

1. Keep hardening easy-mode install, doctor, calibration, and package smoke
   tests until they are boring from a clean public checkout.
2. Maintain standalone CI and release packaging so the standalone repo validates
   itself without relying on private reference repos.
3. Add compatibility wrappers in reference/product repos that can call the standalone
   package when `CODE_MOWER_USE_STANDALONE=1`.
4. Run shadow comparisons between repo-local tools and standalone tools on real
   Code Mower PRs.
5. Flip product repos to use pinned standalone releases by default.
6. Remove duplicated tool implementation files from product repos after at least
   one clean release cycle.

## Wrapper Rehearsal

Before a product repo flips any default, run the package against that repo and
compare safe read-only commands with the repo-local tools:

```bash
code-mower migration wrapper-rehearsal \
  --repo-path /path/to/product-repo \
  --json
```

This command compares provider listing, prompt validation, and calibration
evidence generation when a local calibration corpus is available. A pass means
the repo is ready for standalone shadow mode. It does not mean the repo-local
tools can be deleted yet.

After at least one pinned standalone release is available in a product repo,
render the mirror-removal plan:

```bash
code-mower migration mirror-removal-plan \
  --repo-path /path/to/product-repo \
  --shadow-cycles 1 \
  --standalone-default-cycles 0 \
  --json
```

The plan inventories mirrored files and reports whether the repo has completed
enough clean shadow cycles to flip product wrappers to standalone by default.
Deleting mirrors requires a later clean standalone-default cycle. The plan is
deliberately conservative: inventory is not deletion approval, and product
feature work should not depend on mirror removal.

The expected migration order is:

1. standalone command matches repo-local read-only commands
2. product workflow wrappers can call the standalone command under
   `CODE_MOWER_USE_STANDALONE=1`
3. issue-comment and SaaS reviewer labeler workflows call the standalone
   wrapper entrypoints (`tools/code_mower trailer-comment-labeler ...` and
   `tools/code_mower saas-reviewer-labeler ...`) instead of importing mirrored
   Python files directly
4. setup/bootstrap workflow helpers call `tools/code_mower bootstrap ...`
   instead of `python3 tools/code_mower_bootstrap.py ...`
5. one release cycle runs standalone in shadow mode
6. pinned standalone release becomes the default
7. mirrored implementation files are removed from product repos

As of `v0.1.0-alpha.21`, the private reference/product repos have proved the
standalone checkout path, the standalone-default wrapper path, and the
mirror-removal path. Their product wrappers prefer the pinned standalone
command, workflows call `tools/code_mower` entrypoints, and mirrored
implementation files can be absent while `migration mirror-removal-plan` reports
`mirrors_removed`.

The package should now be treated as the source of truth for product-support
wrapper behavior. Product repos may keep a small reviewed copy of generated
support files (`tools/code_mower`, `tools/code_mower_standalone_shadow.sh`,
`tools/code_mower_standalone_pin.env`, compatibility audit shims, and
`tools/safe_gh_comment.py`), but fixes to checkout locking, Python selection,
deleted-mirror handling, token handling, or shell-safe commenting belong in the
package templates first and are then regenerated into product repos.

`v0.1.0-alpha.19` also makes the default managed checkout directory ref-scoped
with a bounded readable slug plus a short hash of the full ref so sanitized names
cannot collide or exceed normal filesystem component limits. That lets the
shadow wrapper release its checkout lock before the delegated command runs
without allowing a second process on a different ref to mutate the first
process's editable source checkout. The managed venv path is ref-scoped and
hash-suffixed alongside that checkout so one ref cannot reinstall the shared
console script while another ref is about to execute it. Teams that override
`CODE_MOWER_STANDALONE_SOURCE_DIR` or `CODE_MOWER_STANDALONE_VENV` are
responsible for keeping those custom paths isolated per ref if they run
concurrent refs.

`v0.1.0-alpha.20` removes a Claude audit dependency on shared `FETCH_HEAD`
state while building diffs. That matters once product repos run multiple
reviewer lanes against the same checkout: each lane may fetch refs, so diff
builders must use stable ref names or SHAs rather than assuming `FETCH_HEAD`
still belongs to their own most recent fetch.

`v0.1.0-alpha.21` keeps the standalone checkout lock held through delegated
execution. The package is installed editable from the managed checkout, so the
checkout must not be mutated by a second invocation while the first invocation
is importing package code. Ref-scoped default checkout paths still allow
different pinned refs to run independently; shared custom source directories
serialize through their shared lock. The default checkout-lock timeout is long
enough for normal audit runs to queue instead of failing after two minutes;
dead locks are still cleared by the PID/staleness checks.

`v0.1.0-alpha.25` keeps the smoke runner, package plan, docs, and next-step
cloud export examples aligned on reviewer metrics, lane policy, and value
report bundles. Alpha.24 added a packaged starter value-report fixture while
keeping the public starter templates byte-identical to their packaged copies.
Alpha.23 kept the private standalone shadow workflow running
package-install rehearsal through the same authenticated path as checkout. It
separates `CODE_MOWER_STANDALONE_REPO_URL` from
`CODE_MOWER_STANDALONE_PACKAGE_REPO_URL`, prefers an explicit
`CODE_MOWER_STANDALONE_REF` workflow override when present, and otherwise reads
only the ref from the product pin file. That prevents the common failure where a
workflow configures an SSH deploy-key URL, sources the whole pin file, silently
replaces the URL with unauthenticated HTTPS, and fails on the next private
checkout or package install.

That does not make mirror deletion automatic for every user repo. The migration
contract remains one repo at a time:

1. pin a known Code Mower version
2. run `migration wrapper-rehearsal`
3. run `migration package-install-rehearsal` with the pinned package spec
4. run at least one clean standalone-default cycle
5. render `migration mirror-removal-plan --shadow-cycles 1
   --standalone-default-cycles 1`
6. remove mirrored implementation files only when the plan reports no blockers

Now that `code-mower` is public, GitHub Actions can fetch public source over
HTTPS without a deploy key. Deploy keys and fine-grained tokens are still useful
when a team pins a private fork, consumes a private package index, or runs
against private reference branches.

Keep thin migration support files in the product repos while removing mirrors:
`tools/code_mower`, `tools/code_mower_standalone_shadow.sh`, and
`tools/code_mower_standalone_pin.env` are wrappers/config, not duplicated
implementation. Remove implementation mirrors only after workflows no longer
call files such as `tools/trailer_comment_labeler.py` or
`tools/saas_reviewer_labeler.py` directly. Product shell shims such as
`tools/run_codex_audit_pr.sh` and `tools/run_claude_audit_pr.sh` may stay, but
they should call `tools/code_mower codex-audit` and
`tools/code_mower claude-audit` rather than importing local Python modules.
Workflows that need the Code Mower
Python environment should call `tools/code_mower bootstrap --print-python`
instead of importing `tools/code_mower_bootstrap.py` directly.

## Non-Goals

- Do not immediately remove repo-local tools from a user repo before wrapper
  rehearsal, package-install rehearsal, and a clean standalone-default cycle.
- Do not make high-velocity feature work depend on Code Mower migration.
- Do not publish private product history, product-specific secrets, or commercial
  roadmap details in the OSS repo.
